# ai-litellm-fabric

Portable harness fabric for local AI agent CLIs.

This repository manages the wrapper layer around local agent CLIs:

- `ai-litellm`: shared proxy lifecycle, routing, context/reasoning doctors
- `claude-litellm`: Claude Code through OpenRouter's Anthropic-compatible API by default, with a LiteLLM proxy fallback
- `codex-litellm`: Codex CLI through the shared LiteLLM proxy
- `goose-litellm`: goose through the shared LiteLLM proxy
- `opencode-litellm`: OpenCode through the shared LiteLLM proxy

It intentionally does not manage native Claude Code or native Codex state:

- no writes to `~/.claude`
- no writes to `~/.codex`
- no replacement of `claude`, `codex`, `goose`, or `opencode`
- no API keys in git

The installed wrapper layer is one package directory plus thin global command
shims:

- package: `~/.local/share/ai-litellm-fabric`
- commands: `~/.local/bin/*-litellm`

Downloading the repository does not automatically create global commands. Run
`./scripts/install.zsh` once after clone/download; the installer creates shims
that work from any directory.

## What Git Owns

Still not tracked or installed:

- provider API keys
- local model weights, including oMLX models under `~/.omlx/models`

## Install

Prerequisites on the target Mac:

- zsh, node, ruby, jq, curl, python3, perl, rg
- `litellm`
- `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`

Harness CLIs are optional. Install native `claude` only if using
`claude-litellm`, native `codex` only if using `codex-litellm`, and
`goose`/`opencode` only if using those harnesses. A Claude-only machine can
install the package without Codex.

Preview:

```zsh
./scripts/install.zsh --dry-run
```

Install:

```zsh
./scripts/install.zsh
```

The installer preflights shared dependencies, writes only the LiteLLM wrapper
layer, and creates a local LiteLLM master key if one is not already available:

- `~/.local/share/ai-litellm-fabric/config`
- `~/.local/share/ai-litellm-fabric/bin`
- `~/.local/share/ai-litellm-fabric/docs`
- `~/.local/share/ai-litellm-fabric/scripts`
- `~/.local/share/ai-litellm-fabric/state`
- `~/.local/bin/ai-litellm`
- `~/.local/bin/claude-litellm`
- `~/.local/bin/codex-litellm`
- `~/.local/bin/goose-litellm`
- `~/.local/bin/opencode-litellm`
- `~/.local/bin/openrouter-key-status`
- `~/.local/bin/litellm-master-key-status`

It creates isolated runtime directories but leaves native app directories alone.
It does not write `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, or `~/litellm_config.yaml`.

Uninstall the package/shims:

```zsh
ai-litellm uninstall
```

The installed fallback is also self-contained:

```zsh
~/.local/share/ai-litellm-fabric/scripts/uninstall.zsh
```

If migrating from an older spread-out install, preview legacy cleanup first:

```zsh
./scripts/uninstall.zsh --legacy --dry-run
```

## Secrets

Store keys outside git. On macOS, prefer Keychain storage so provider keys do
not live in the package directory:

```zsh
ai-litellm key set --keychain openrouter
ai-litellm key status
```

You can also set arbitrary provider env keys:

```zsh
ai-litellm key set --keychain OPENAI_API_KEY
ai-litellm key set --keychain anthropic
```

Omit the value and enter it at the hidden prompt. Passing a secret as a command
argument can leave it in shell history or process inspection output.

For throwaway or non-macOS installs, the package also supports a private env
file, which is removed with `ai-litellm uninstall`:

```zsh
ai-litellm key set --env-file openrouter
```

For additional providers referenced as `os.environ/NAME` in
`config/litellm_config.yaml`, the default Keychain service is the lowercase
dash form of the variable name. Example: `OPENAI_API_KEY` uses service
`openai-api-key`.

## First Run

```zsh
ai-litellm key set --keychain openrouter
ai-litellm key status
ai-litellm sync
ai-litellm context doctor
ai-litellm reasoning doctor
ai-litellm proxy doctor
```

`ai-litellm sync` regenerates derived config and restarts the shared proxy by
default, which can interrupt active LiteLLM-backed sessions. Use
`ai-litellm sync --dry-run` to inspect actions first, or `--no-restart` to
regenerate without bouncing the proxy.

Supported harnesses are optional on each machine. `sync`, `doctor`, and
metadata commands must skip missing native CLIs cleanly; only launching that
specific harness requires its native command. `sync` also ensures the isolated
Claude Code settings file exists without touching `~/.claude`.

OpenRouter backend names can be used directly where a model is accepted. The
wrapper resolves them back to the configured `model_name` without duplicating
routes in git:

```zsh
ai-litellm model limits openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro
ai-litellm model info openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro
```

For Codex, a raw provider slug is resolved to a Codex-safe facade such as
`gpt-5.5` when that backend is shared by multiple routes. The same provider
slug can be used in place of the model argument in the harness smoke tests
below.

Then test one harness. Claude Code defaults to the thin OpenRouter direct path
documented by OpenRouter for Claude Code: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is
`https://openrouter.ai/api`, the OpenRouter key is injected as
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is explicitly blanked to avoid
auth conflicts. The default direct tier is `sonnet`; use `opus` explicitly for
the higher-cost Opus tier.

```zsh
claude-litellm sonnet -p 'Reply with exactly OK' --no-session-persistence --tools ''
codex-litellm exec --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox read-only 'Reply with exactly OK'
```

Those harness smoke tests make real provider requests and may be billable.

Use the LiteLLM proxy path explicitly when you want the curated non-Claude
OpenRouter routes or local runtime routes from the registry:

```zsh
claude-litellm --proxy haiku -p 'Reply with exactly OK' --no-session-persistence --tools ''
claude-litellm --proxy local-omlx-gemma4-12b -p 'Reply with exactly LOCAL_OK' --no-session-persistence --tools ''
```

## Local Models

The repository tracks local runtime wiring, not model weights. OpenRouter routes
are curated recommendations, but local oMLX models are machine-specific.

`local-omlx-gemma4-12b` remains a sample/recommended route. When oMLX is running,
`ai-litellm sync` also reads `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models` and generates
routes for the models this computer actually serves, such as:

```zsh
ai-litellm runtime status omlx
ai-litellm sync
ai-litellm model list | grep '^  local-omlx-'
```

Generated local routes use the `local-omlx-...` prefix and point at the exact
runtime model id advertised by oMLX. The actual oMLX installation and files
under `~/.omlx/models` remain machine-local.

## Token Budget Policy

Model capability and request reservation are separate concepts.

- Capability lives in `config/litellm_config.yaml` under `x-limits` and
  `model_info`.
- Harness-specific reservation lives in the harness descriptor when needed.

Some proxy-backed harnesses need explicit output reservation handling because
they send or infer per-request `max_tokens` values:

- Claude Code proxy fallback: `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`
- Codex LiteLLM: generated catalog `context_window` for OpenRouter-backed
  slugs is reduced to the safe input budget because Codex does not expose a
  reliable Responses output cap
- goose: `GOOSE_MAX_TOKENS`
- OpenCode: `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_OUTPUT_TOKEN_MAX` for the custom
  OpenAI-compatible provider ceiling

For shared-window providers, the effective input budget is:

```text
effective_input = max_input_tokens - output_reservation - tokenizer_headroom
```

Other token-limit issues can still happen, but the failure mode differs:

- Codex LiteLLM: generated model catalog/config can drift from `x-limits`.
- LiteLLM proxy: `enable_pre_call_checks` enforces configured input limits, not
  every provider-specific reserved-output accounting rule.

To re-check gateway-side output clamping against the installed LiteLLM version:

```zsh
./scripts/verify_litellm_token_clamp.py
```

Current local result with LiteLLM 1.81.14: plain config does not override a
larger client `max_tokens`; `litellm_settings.modify_params: true` clamps
`max_tokens` but not `max_completion_tokens`; a custom
`async_pre_call_deployment_hook` clamps both before the mock provider receives
the request. The production proxy enables this hook and also rejects prompts
above the configured estimated-token guardrail before provider dispatch.

Use the doctors as the contract:

```zsh
ai-litellm model limits
ai-litellm context matrix
ai-litellm context observations
ai-litellm context doctor
ai-litellm proxy doctor
```

## Maintenance Boundary

When adding or changing models:

1. Update `config/litellm_config.yaml`.
2. Keep one `x-limits` anchor per underlying backend model.
3. Update harness aliases/descriptors only when the user-facing slot changes.
4. Run `ai-litellm sync`.
5. Run the doctor commands.

Do not encode native Codex/Claude product context claims in this wrapper project.
Native surfaces must be diagnosed separately from LiteLLM surfaces.
