    """Freeze-guard: the blocking spawn must NOT block the asyncio event loop.

    Design: use a background OS ticker thread (not asyncio) to record
    timestamps independently of the event loop.  The spawn blocks on a gate
    for ~300ms.  We compare ticker timestamps DURING the spawn window to the
    spawn window: if ANY async ticker timestamp appears between spawn_start
    and spawn_end, the event loop was free (fix).  The OS-thread ticker always
    runs regardless; the asyncio ticker only runs if the loop is free.

    Why RED on the buggy code: the async ticker coroutine (await asyncio.sleep)
    cannot fire while the event loop is frozen by the blocking spawn.  It
    records 0 ticks before spawn_end → FAIL.

    Why GREEN after the fix: the spawn runs in a thread pool; the event loop
    is free; the async ticker fires many times in the 300ms window → PASS.
